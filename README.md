# JavaKotlinPractice

This is a project written around May 2023 intended to practice my Java and to learn 
Kotlin. Here I'm writing some basic algorithms and data structures from scratch using mainly Kotlin 
for the main code and Java for testing. All algorithms and structures include a suite of unit tests.
